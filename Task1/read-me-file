# Titanic Data Preprocessing and Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used for machine learning and data analysis tasks, containing information about the passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic.

## Overview

The notebook includes the following key sections:

1. **Introduction**
   - Brief introduction to the Titanic dataset and its significance in data science and machine learning.

2. **Data Loading**
   - Loading the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Overview of the dataset structure, including the number of rows and columns, data types, and summary statistics.
   - Identification of missing values and unique values in categorical columns.

4. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values by filling or dropping them as appropriate.
   - Normalizing numerical features (e.g., Age and Fare) using Min-Max scaling.
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., converting 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical format).

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualizations to understand the distribution of features and relationships between variables (e.g., survival rates based on gender, class, etc.).

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of findings and insights gained from the analysis.

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger in years.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Fare paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available).
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
